<!--
In this section, we explain how to get started with the dataset and modeling. For ease all the necessary element and codes are put into one python library called - ***phyaat***. Here we explain the functionalities that Phyaat library has with possible tuning the process of preprocessing and feature extractions. To start with a quick exmaple to preditive modeling check the [**Predictive Modeling**  ](/modeling) tab.
